# 🧠 Habit Forge – JavaFX Practice Project

### 📋 Overview
Habit Forge is a small JavaFX project I am building as part of my learning journey.  
The idea is to create a simple habit-tracking app where you can add habits, complete them, gain XP, level up, and track streaks.

This project is **not finished** and is mainly being developed for **practice and learning purposes**, especially to improve my skills with JavaFX, Scene Builder, Maven, and MySQL integration.

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Get comfortable working with JavaFX and FXML  
- Practice connecting UI controllers to logic  
- Learn how to structure a project using Maven  
- Work with MySQL from a JavaFX application  
- Experiment with state management (XP, levels, streaks)  
- Improve my understanding of storing and retrieving data  
- Build something simple from scratch to gain experience

---

## 🚀 Planned Features (Work in Progress)
- Add, edit, and delete habits  
- Gain XP when completing habits  
- Simple hybrid leveling system  
- Track streaks  
- Basic dashboard for XP and level  
- Save and load user data using a MySQL database

These features may change as I continue learning.

---

## 🎨 UI Goals
- Use Scene Builder to design FXML layouts  
- Keep the interface simple and readable  
- Display a list of habits  
- Show XP progress and current level  
- Keep navigation clean and beginner-friendly

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Java 17+  
- JavaFX  
- Scene Builder  
- Maven  
- MySQL (via JDBC)

---

## 🚧 Project Status
This is an **early-stage learning project**.  
I am building it step-by-step to understand:

- How JavaFX applications are structured  
- How controllers and FXML work together  
- How to use MySQL in a desktop application  
- How to manage data and application state  
- How to design a simple but functional UI  

The project will change a lot as I learn more, and many features are still incomplete.

## 💬 Notes
This project is primarily for **practice**, not for production or serious use.  
I am using it to explore JavaFX, experiment freely, make mistakes, and improve slowly over time.
